# bugpacker-cli

Read a [Bugpacker](https://bugpacker.com) bug package from disk, on the command line or
over MCP.

Bugpacker is a Chrome extension that records a bug while you reproduce it and saves a
single ZIP: screenshots, console output, failed requests, a HAR, the DOM, the state of
every form field, and the steps you took. Nothing it captures leaves your machine.

This is the tool that reads one back.

> **Status:** early. The package format is stable and published, but this is not
> released yet. Expect the surface to move.

## Why it exists

Every other tool in this category can hand a coding agent your bug report because it is
already on their servers. Bugpacker's is a file, so it needs a different route: a local
reader for the file you already have.

Same feature, opposite data path. The agent gets the console error, the failing request
and the repro steps; nobody else gets anything.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g bugpacker-cli
```

## Use it from a terminal

```sh
bugpacker show <package.zip>       # everything, summarised
bugpacker steps <package.zip>      # repro steps, expected and actual
bugpacker console <package.zip>    # console output, uncaught errors, CSP violations
bugpacker network <package.zip>    # failed requests, kept apart from ad-blocked noise
bugpacker har <package.zip>        # the full session as HAR
bugpacker files <package.zip>      # what is in the package
bugpacker json <package.zip>       # report.json, for piping into something else
```

Pull artifacts out when you want them as files:

```sh
bugpacker extract <package.zip> --out ./bug           # everything
bugpacker extract <package.zip> network.har --out .   # just one
```

The HAR is the usual reason: it is worth little in a terminal and a lot in DevTools,
which needs it on disk.

## Use it from a coding agent

> Not implemented yet. This is what it will be.

```sh
bugpacker mcp <package.zip>
```

Starts an MCP server over stdio exposing the package as tools an agent can call. Point
Claude Code, Cursor or any other MCP client at it and ask it to fix the bug.

## Why some commands just print

`console`, `network` and `har` print what the extension already rendered rather than
building a second view of the same data. Those files draw the distinction that matters
most in them, between a request that reached a server and failed and one an ad blocker
killed before it left the browser, and a second renderer here would be one more thing
to keep in step with a format this repo does not own.

## The format

Every package contains `report.json`, the machine-readable source of record, alongside
the human-readable renderings generated from it. The schema is published at
[bugpacker.com/report.schema.json](https://bugpacker.com/report.schema.json) and travels
inside every package, so a consumer behind an egress allowlist can validate a file it
was just handed without a network request.

This tool reads that schema and nothing else. It has no knowledge of the extension, and
it never makes a network request of its own.

A package written by a newer extension than this CLI understands is refused with a note
to update, rather than read with its unknown fields guessed at. An older one is read as
it is.
